<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Three compartment Knee Prosthesis Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cemented Bone</li><li>Non-Cemented Bone</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The three-compartment knee prosthesis market comprises two primary types: cemented and non-cemented bone systems. Cemented bone prostheses rely on polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) to bond the implant to the bone, providing immediate stability and strength. In contrast, non-cemented bone prostheses utilize a porous surface that encourages bone ingrowth over time, ensuring long-term stability without cement. Each type is designed to accommodate different patient needs, activity levels, and bone conditions, influencing surgical preferences and outcomes.</p></p>
