<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Land-based RAS Aquaculture Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed Type</li><li>Semi-closed Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Land-based RAS (Recirculating Aquaculture Systems) aquaculture divides into two main market types: closed and semi-closed systems. Closed systems completely recirculate water, minimizing water exchange and limiting environmental impact while providing precise control over water quality and fish health. In contrast, semi-closed systems partially recycle water, combining recirculation with some fresh water input to maintain water quality, though they may have a higher environmental footprint. Both types are designed to optimize fish production in a sustainable manner.</p></p>
